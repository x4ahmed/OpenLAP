This variation of a Bar Chart can be used when two or more data series need to be plotted all on the same axis and grouped into parent categories. \n\n Like on a Bar Chart, the length of each bar on a Multiset Bar Chart is used to show discrete, numerical comparisons amongst categories. Each bar for a data series is assigned a colour to distinguish them apart. Bars in the same group are placed together and are then spaced apart from other bar groupings. \n\n The use of Multiset Bar Charts is usually to compare across categories that contain the same sub-categorical variables between them. Each bar is a subcategory that is grouped into a larger parent category. \n\n Multiset Bar Charts can also be used to compare mini Histograms to each other, so each bar in the group would represent the significant intervals of a variable. Another use could be to use Multiset Bar Charts to show data changing over time by having, for example, each bar represent a point in time such as a year. \n\n The downside of Multiset Bar Charts is that they become harder to read the more bars you have in one group.

  //     "Heatmaps visualise data through variations in colouring. When applied to a tabular format, Heatmaps are useful for cross-examining multivariate data, through placing variables in the rows and columns and colouring the cells within the table. Heatmaps are good for showing variance across multiple variables, revealing any patterns, displaying whether any variables are similar to each other, and for detecting if any correlations exist. \n\n Typically, all the rows are one category (labels displayed on the left or right side) and all the columns are another category (labels displayed on the top or bottom). The individual rows and columns are divided into the subcategories, which all match up with each other in a matrix. The cells are the intersections of the rows and columns, which can either contain categorical data or numerical data. \n\n  A legend is required alongside a Heatmap in order for it to be successfully read. Categorical data is colour-coded, while numerical data requires a colour scale that blends from one colour to another, in order to represent the difference in high and low values. A selection of solid colours can be used to represent multiple value ranges (0-10, 11-20, 21-30, etc) or you can use a gradient scale for a single range (for example 0 - 100) by blending two or more colours together. \n\n Because of their reliance on colour to communicate values, Heatmaps are a chart better suited to displaying a more generalised view of numerical data, as it’s harder to accurately tell the differences between colour shades and to extract specific data points from. However, this problem can be remedied by displaying the data values inside the cells. \n\n Heatmaps can also be used to show the changes in data over time if one of the rows or columns are set to time intervals. An example of this would be to use a Heatmap to compare the temperature changes across the year in multiple cities, to see where’s the hottest or coldest places. So the rows could list the cities to compare, the columns contain each month and the cells would contain the temperature values.",

A Line Graph is most frequently used to show trends and analyse how the data has changed over time. \n\n Line Graphs are drawn by first plotting data points on a Cartesian coordinate grid, and then connecting a line between all of these points. Typically, the y-axis has a quantitative value, while the x-axis is a timescale or a sequence of intervals. Negative values can be displayed below the x-axis. \n\n  The direction of the lines on the graph works as a nice metaphor for the data: an upward slope indicates where values have increased and a downward slope indicates where values have decreased. The line's journey across the graph can create patterns that reveal trends in a dataset. \n\nWhen grouped with other lines (other data series), individual lines can be compared to one another. However, avoid using more than 3-4 lines per graph, as this makes the chart more cluttered and harder to read.

However, the major downsides to pie charts are: \n\n  They cannot show more than a few values, because as the number of values shown increases, the size of each segment/slice becomes smaller. This makes them unsuitable for large datasets with many categories. \n\n They take up more space than their alternatives, for example, a 100% Stacked Bar Chart. Mainly due to their size and the usual need for a legend. \n\n They are not great for making accurate comparisons between groups of Pie Charts.
